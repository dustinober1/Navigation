## Learning Algorithm

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with the following key components:

1. **Experience Replay**: Stores experiences in a replay buffer and samples randomly to break correlation between consecutive experiences
2. **Fixed Q-Targets**: Uses two neural networks (local and target) to stabilize training
3. **Epsilon-Greedy Action Selection**: Balances exploration and exploitation

### Neural Network Architecture

The Q-Network consists of:
- **Input Layer**: 37 units (state size)
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 64 units with ReLU activation
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 64 units with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 4 units (action size)

```python
QNetwork(
  (fc1): Linear(37, 64)
  (fc2): Linear(64, 64)
  (fc3): Linear(64, 4)
)
```

| Epsilon Start | 1.0 | Initial exploration rate |
| Epsilon End | 0.01 | Minimum exploration rate |

## Plot of Rewards

![Training Progress](training_progress.png)

The agent achieved the following milestones:
- Episode 100: Average Score = 1.28
- Episode 200: Average Score = 4.77
- Episode 300: Average Score = 8.35
- Episode 400: Average Score = 10.58
- **Episode 490: Average Score = 13.01 (Environment Solved!)**

The environment was solved in **390 episodes** (100 episodes before reaching the average of 13.01).

## Algorithm Details

### Training Process

1. **Initialize** replay memory with capacity N
2. **Initialize** action-value function Q with random weights
3. **Initialize** target action-value function Q̂ with weights θ⁻ = θ
4. **For each episode**:
   - Initialize environment and get initial state
   - For each step:
     - Select action using ε-greedy policy
     - Execute action and observe reward and next state
     - Store experience in replay buffer
     - Sample random minibatch from replay buffer
     - Compute target values using fixed Q-targets
     - Update Q-network using gradient descent
     - Soft update target network

### Loss Function

The DQN minimizes the following loss function:

```
L(θ) = E[(r + γ max_a' Q̂(s', a'; θ⁻) - Q(s, a; θ))²]
```

Where:
- `r` is the reward
- `γ` is the discount factor
- `Q̂` is the target network
- `Q` is the local network

## Ideas for Future Work

### 1. **Double DQN**
Implement Double DQN to reduce overestimation bias by decoupling action selection from action evaluation.

### 2. **Prioritized Experience Replay**
Sample important experiences more frequently based on TD error magnitude, improving learning efficiency.

### 3. **Dueling DQN**
Separate the network into two streams (value and advantage) to better estimate state values.

### 4. **Rainbow DQN**
Combine multiple improvements (Double DQN, Prioritized Replay, Dueling Networks, Multi-step Learning, Distributional RL, and Noisy Networks).

### 5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Implement systematic hyperparameter search using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization
- Experiment with different network architectures (deeper networks, different activation functions)

### 6. **Learning from Pixels**
Train the agent directly from raw pixel inputs instead of pre-processed state vectors, making the solution more general.

### 7. **Transfer Learning**
Test the trained agent's ability to generalize to slightly modified environments or different reward structures.

### 8. **Curriculum Learning**
Start with simpler versions of the environment and gradually increase difficulty to potentially speed up training.

## Conclusion

The implemented DQN agent successfully solves the Banana Collector environment in 390 episodes, demonstrating efficient learning. The agent shows steady improvement throughout training, with consistent performance after convergence. Future enhancements could further improve sample efficiency and final performance.
